<!-- About --> 

# About 🤔
This repository is intended as a reference book on various topics related to native iOS app development in Swift.

There will be basic, intermediate, and advanced topics categorized by area of study, not by difficulty. However, there is a table later on with all the content and the difficulty level of each topic.

Contributions are welcome, but please follow the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING-ENG.md).

<!-- Disclaimer --> 

# ☣️ Before we continue...
I am by no means a guru, enlightened being, or genius. I am a programmer with a mix of knowledge and gaps, with strengths and weaknesses. If you notice something that is incorrect, please approach that knowledge gap with a collaborative mindset and a spirit of teaching. Twitter is the place for negativity, not here.
